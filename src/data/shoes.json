We built a sleek and comfortable silhouette with sustainability in mind. It's made from at least 25% recycled material by weight and comes equipped with a partially recycled Air Zoom Strobel designed to help you be efficient off the dribble or effective on defense. This is trash, transformed into a tool for basketball players to get a little more out of their game while taking a little less from the planet"
